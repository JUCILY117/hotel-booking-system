# Client-side environment variables for Ezy Motel (Vite)
# ======================================================
# Copy this file to `.env` (or `.env.local`) in the `client/` folder and
# fill the values below. These variables are embedded into the frontend
# bundle at build time. Never put sensitive server-only secrets here.
#
# Vite requires client-exposed variables to be prefixed with `VITE_`.

# Base URL for the backend API used by the client.
# Example values:
# - Development (local server): http://localhost:4000
# - Production: https://api.your-domain.example
# Use the full origin (protocol + host + optional port). Do not include a trailing slash.
VITE_API_BASE_URL=

# Optional: Public API keys for third-party client-only SDKs
# If your frontend needs to call third-party services directly (e.g., maps,
# analytics, or image providers), put their public keys here. Keep only public
# keys — never include private keys or secrets in client env files.
# Example:
# VITE_UNSPLASH_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key
# VITE_MAPS_API_KEY=public_maps_api_key

# Development tips
# - You can create a `.env.local` for machine-specific values (ignored by git).
# - After changing `.env` values, restart the dev server (`npm run dev`) so
#   Vite picks up the new values.

# Security reminders
# - Anything in these variables is visible to users (sent with the JS bundle).
# - Do not store passwords, JWT secrets, or other sensitive values here.
